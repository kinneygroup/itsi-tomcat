### Services
Tomcat monitoring encompasses several specialized services, each targeting specific aspects of server performance:

1. Tomcat Application
    * Description: The overall Tomcat application responsible for hosting and managing web applications.
2. JVM Performance
    * Description: Monitors the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) performance metrics crucial for Tomcat's operation.
3. Tomcat Metrics
    * Description: Specific metrics related to Tomcat's performance and request handling.
4. Resource Utilization
    * Description: Monitors the resource usage of the Tomcat server, including CPU and Disk I/O.
5. Application Performance
    * Description: Measures the performance of applications running on Tomcat, including response times and database connection pool usage.
6. Log Monitoring
    * Description: Regularly reviews and analyzes Tomcat's error and access logs.
7. Service Availability
    * Description: Ensures the high availability and uptime of the Tomcat server.
8. Configuration Management
    * Description: Manages and monitors changes to Tomcat's configuration files and ensures proper backup and recovery procedures.

### KPIs
Each service utilizes specific KPIs to measure its effectiveness:

1. Heap Memory Usage
    * Description: Monitor the used, committed, and maximum heap memory to prevent OutOfMemoryErrors.
2. Garbage Collection Activity
    * Description: Track the frequency and duration of GC events to identify potential performance bottlenecks.
3. Thread Usage
    * Description: Keep an eye on the number of active, idle, and total threads to ensure the server can handle incoming requests efficiently.
4. Request Throughput
    * Description: Measure the number of requests processed per second to gauge server load.
5. Error Rates
    * Description: Track HTTP error rates, specifically 4xx (client errors) and 5xx (server errors), to identify issues with request handling.
6. Session Count
    * Description: Monitor the number of active sessions to understand user load and session management efficiency.
7. CPU Usage
    * Description: High CPU usage can indicate inefficient code or excessive load. Monitor CPU usage to ensure it remains within acceptable limits.
8. Disk I/O
    * Description: Track disk read/write operations to detect potential bottlenecks in data access and storage.
9. Response Time
    * Description: Measure the average response time for requests to ensure the application is responsive.
10. Database Connection Pool
    * Description: Monitor the usage of database connections to prevent connection pool exhaustion, which can lead to application downtime.
11. Error Logs
    * Description: Regularly review Tomcat's error logs to identify and address issues promptly.
12. Access Logs
    * Description: Analyze access logs to understand traffic patterns and detect any unusual activity.
13. Uptime
    * Description: Track the uptime of the Tomcat server to ensure high availability.
14. Service Checks
    * Description: Implement regular health checks to verify that the server and its services are running correctly.
15. Configuration Files
    * Description: Monitor changes to configuration files to detect unauthorized modifications.
16. Backup and Recovery
    * Description: Implement regular backups and test recovery procedures to ensure data integrity and availability.

### Relationships
#### Dependencies:
Services are interconnected; for instance, the Tomcat Application is dependent on JVM Performance, Tomcat Metrics, Resource Utilization, and other services to ensure optimal performance and reliability.

#### Hierarchical Structure:
Some services form a hierarchy, such as JVM Performance depending on Heap Memory Usage, Garbage Collection Activity, and Thread Usage, illustrating a layered approach to performance monitoring where base metrics support broader performance indicators.
